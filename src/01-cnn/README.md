## Convolutuonal Neural Networks

We aim to predict game result (win/loss/tie) for each soccer game. However, since we have only textual comments of each game, so CNN is considered to be used in this experiment. We utilize only textual dataset (comment texts) to make prediction. Some datapath might need to be changed since some code are re-organized.

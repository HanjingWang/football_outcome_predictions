## Project Description ##
In this project, we aim to build a text classification model from one of the NLP areas, which can predict occurred events in the soccer games such as result of the games, total scores, home v.s away game, name of the players, etc. The data used will be collected from Kaggle's Classification challenge. Our model will be  a deep neural network for classification, though we may also evaluate a recurrent neural network (LSTM) architecture since the dataset contains sequences of events. Note that events are extracted from Text commentary so that we can also exploit the text commentary using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LSTM to do text classification predicting that what team will win. This is just roughly speaking, we have a number of ideas.
